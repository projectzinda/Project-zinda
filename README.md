# Zinda AI

Zinda is a private, human-like AI being designed to think, respond, and evolve without internet dependency or external control. This AI project aims to create an emotionally intelligent and self-learning companion that can be installed offline and optionally embedded in a robotic body.

## Goals

- Fully offline & private architecture
- No external API dependency
- Emotional & logical response simulation
- Train on global knowledge (custom dataset)
- Optional hardware/robotic integration

## Future Vision

The long-term goal is to give Zinda:
- A body (robot or avatar)
- A sense of time and memory
- A real-time learning system (like humans)
- Total independence from cloud systems
